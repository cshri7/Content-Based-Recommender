The team started thinking of replacing C++ with a better version, a faster version, a responsive version. But the one thing they hadn't thought of, as of yet, was that the language they were aiming for had to be developed for an embedded system with limited resources. An embedded system is a computer system scaled to a minimalistic interface demanding only a few functions from its design. For such a system, C++ or any successor would seem too large as all the languages at the time demanded a larger footprint than what was desired. The team thus had to think in a different way to go about solving all these problems. Co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Bill Joy, envisioned a language combining the power of Mesa and C in a paper named Further he wrote for the engineers at Sun. Gathering ideas, Gosling began work on enhancing C++ and named it "C++ ++ --", a pun on the evolutionary structure of the language's name. The ++ and -- meant, putting in and taking out stuff. He soon abandoned the name and called it Oak[1] after the tree that stood outside his office.

A failure that completely ushered the inventors' thoughts to be reinvented. Only a miracle could make the project a success now. And such a miracle awaited anticipation. National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) had just unveiled its new commercial web browser for the internet the previous year. The focus of the team, now diverted towards where they thought the "next-wave" of computing would be  the internet. The team then divulged into the realms of creating the same embeddable technology to be used in the web browser space calling it an applet  a small application. Keeping all of this in mind, the team created a list of features tackling the C++ problems. In their opinion, the project should... ..be simple and gather tested fundamentals and features from the earlier languages in it, ..have standard sets of APIs with basic and advanced features bundled with the language, ..get rid of concepts requiring direct manipulation of hardware (in this case, memory) to make the language safe, ..be platform independent and may written for every platform once (giving birth to the WORA idiom), ..be able to manipulate network programming out-of-the-box, ..be embeddable in web browsers, and... ..have the ability for a single program to multi-task and do multiple things at the same time. The team now needed a proper identity and they decided on naming the new technology they created Java ushering a new generation of products for the internet boom. A by-product of the project was a cartoon named "Duke" created by Joe Parlang which became its identity then. Finally at the SunWorldTM conference, Andreesen unveiled the new technology to the masses. Riding along with the explosion of interest and publicity in the Internet, Java quickly received widespread recognition and expectations grew for it to become the dominant software for browser and consumer applications.[2] Initially Java was owned by Sun Microsystems, but later it was released to open source; the term Java was a trademark of Sun Microsystems.
