The java.lang.Object.notify() and java.lang.Object.notifyAll() methods remove one or more threads from an object's wait list and add them to the set of executable threads.  notify removes a single thread from the wait list, while notifyAll removes all threads from the wait list.  Which thread is removed by notify is unspecified and dependent on the JVM implementation. The notify methods must be called inside of a block or method synchronized on the object.  This insures that there are no race conditions between wait and notify.
