In addition to primitive types, Java supports reference type. A reference type is a Java data type which is defined by a Java class or interface. Reference types derive this name because such values refer to an object or contain a reference to an object. The idea is similar to pointers in other languages like C. Java represents sequences of character data, or String, with the reference type java.lang.String which is most commonly referred to as String. String literals, such as  "Distance between " are constants whose type is String. This program uses three separate reference types: For more information see chapter: Java Programming/Classes, Objects and Types.
