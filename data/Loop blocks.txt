Loops are a handy tool that enables programmers to do repetitive tasks with minimal effort. Say we want a program that can count from 1 to 10, we could write the following program. Code listing 3.4: Count.java 1 class Count { 2     public static void main(String[] args) { 3         System.out.println("1 "); 4         System.out.println("2 "); 5         System.out.println("3 "); 6         System.out.println("4 "); 7         System.out.println("5 "); 8         System.out.println("6 "); 9         System.out.println("7 ");10         System.out.println("8 ");11         System.out.println("9 ");12         System.out.println("10 ");13     }14 }Output for code listing 3.412345678910 The task will be completed just fine, the numbers 1 to 10 will be printed in the output, but there are a few problems with this solution: Flexibility:  what if we wanted to change the start number or end number? We would have to go through and change them, adding extra lines of code where they're needed. Scalability: 10 repeats are trivial, but what if we wanted 100 or even 1000 repeats? The number of lines of code needed would be overwhelming for a large number of iterations. Maintenance: where there is a large amount of code, one is more likely to make a mistake. Feature: the number of tasks is fixed and doesn't change at each execution. Using loops we can solve all these problems. Once you get you head around them they will be invaluable to solving many problems in programming. Open up your editing program and create a new file saved as Loop.java. Now type or copy the following code: Code listing 3.5: Loop.java1 class Loop {2     public static void main(String[] args) {3         int i;4         for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {5             System.out.println(i + " ");6         }7     }8 }Output for code listing 3.512345678910 If we run the program, the same result is produced, but looking at the code, we immediately see the advantages of loops. Instead of executing 10 different lines of code, line 5 executes ten times. 10 lines of code have been reduced to just 4. Furthermore, we may change the number 10 to any number we like. Try it yourself, replace the 10 with your own number.
