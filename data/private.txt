private is a Java keywordwhich declares a member's accessas private. That is, the member is only visible within the class,not from any other class (including subclasses). The visibility of private members extends to nested classes. Please note: Because access modifiers are not handled at instance level but at class level, private members of an object are visible from other instances of the same class!
