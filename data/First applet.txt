The two things you must at least create is an HTML page and a Java class. It can be done on a local folder, no need to run a server but it will be harder to understand what is local, what is remote. The HTML page has to call the Java class using the <applet/> markup: Code listing 9.3: HelloWorld.html1 <!DOCTYPE html>2 <html>3   <body>4     HTML content before the applet.<applet code="HelloWorld" height="40" width="200"></applet>HTML content after the applet.5   </body>6 </html> Save this file on a folder. As the <applet/> markup is calling a Java class called HelloWorld, our class should be called HelloWorld.java: Code listing 9.4: HelloWorld.java 1 import java.applet.Applet; 2 import java.awt.Graphics; 3  4 public class HelloWorld extends Applet { 5  6     /** 7      * Print a message on the screen. 8      */ 9     public void paint(Graphics g) {10         g.drawString("Hello, world!", 20, 10);11     }12 } Save this file and compile the class on the same folder. Now let's open the web page on a browser:  Figure 9.8: Java applet HelloWorld. We clearly see that "Hello, world!" is not rendered the same way as the rest of the page.
