For example, to compile and run a class from a project's top directory (that contains the two directories /source and /libraries) you could use the following command: Compilation$ javac -classpath libraries/lib.jar source/MainClass.java And then to run it, similarly: Execution$ java -classpath libraries/lib.jar source/MainClass The above is simplified, and demands that MainClass be in the default package, or a package called source, which isn't very desirable.
