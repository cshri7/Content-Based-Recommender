The primitive types are passed in by value. It means that as soon as the primitive type is passed in, there is no more link between the value inside the method and the source variable: Code section 3.69: A method modifying a variable.1 private void modifyValue(int number) {2   number += 1;3 } Code section 3.70: Passing primitive value to method.1 int i = 0;2 modifyValue(i);3 System.out.println(i);Output for Code section 3.700   As you can see in code section 3.70, the modifyValue() method has not modified the value of i.
