Conditional expressions use the compound ?: operator. Syntax: boolean expression1? expression1: expression2 This evaluates boolean expression1, and if it is true then the conditional expression has the value of expression1; otherwise the conditional expression has the value of expression2. Example: Code section 3.24: Conditional expressions.1 String answer = (p < 0.05)? "reject" : "keep"; This is equivalent to the following code fragment: Code section 3.25: Equivalent code.1 String answer;2 if (p < 0.05) {3     answer = "reject";4 } else {5     answer = "keep";6 }
