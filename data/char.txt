char is a keyword. It defines a character primitive type. char can be created from character literals and numeric representation. Character literals consist of a single quote character (') (ASCII 39, hex 0x27), a single character, and a close quote ('), such as 'w'. Instead of a character, you can also use unicode escape sequences, but there must be exactly one. Syntax: char variable name1 = 'character1'; Code section 1: Three examples.1 char oneChar1 = 'A';2 char oneChar2 = 65;3 char oneChar3 = '\u0041';4 System.out.println(oneChar1);5 System.out.println(oneChar2);6 System.out.println(oneChar3);Output for Code section 1AAA 65 is the numeric representation of character 'A' , or its ASCII code. The nominal wrapper class is the java.lang.Character class when you need to store a char value but an object reference is required. Code section 2: char wrapping.1 char aCharPrimitiveType = 'A';2 Character aCharacterObject = aCharPrimitiveType; See also: Java Programming/Primitive Types
