As of version 5, Java provides a class in the java.util package called Scanner that simplifies keyboard input. Code section 9.3: Inputting with ScannerScanner kbdIn = new Scanner(System.in); // Instantiating a new Scanner objectSystem.out.print("Enter your name: "); // Printing out the promptString name = kbdIn.nextLine(); // Reading a line of input (until the user hits enter) from the keyboard// and putting it in a String variable called nameSystem.out.println("Welcome, " + name); // Printing out welcome, followed by the user's name On the screenEnter your name: John DoeWelcome, John Doe Alternatively, one could write a method to handle keyboard input: Code section 9.4: Line readerpublic String readLine() {  // Creates a new BufferedReader object  BufferedReader x = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));  // Reads a line of input and returns it directly  return x.readLine();} Note that the code above shouldn't be used in most applications, as it creates new Objects every time the method is run.A better alternative would be to create a separate class file to handle keyboard input.
