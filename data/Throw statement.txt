A throw statement exits from a method and so on and so on or it is caught by a try/catch block. It does not return a variable but an exception: Code section 3.20: A return statement.1     public int getAge() {2         throw new NullPointerException();3     } Beware not to write statements after a throw statement which would not be executed too! Each throw statement is ended by a semi-colon (;). A try/catch must at least contain the try block and the catch block: Code section 3.21: try/catch block.1 try {2   // Some code3 } catch (Exception e) {4   // Optional exception handling5 } finally {6   // This code is executed no matter what7 } Test your knowledgeQuestion 3.1: How many statements are there in this class?Code listing 3.2: AProgram.java 1 public class AProgram { 2  3     private int age = 24; 4  5     public static void main(String[] args) { 6         int daysInAYear = 365;int ageInDay = 100000; 7         int localAge = ageInDay / daysInAYear; 8     } 9 10     public int getAge() {11         return age;12     }13 }Answer5One statement at line 3, two statements at line 6, one statement at line 7 and one statement at line 11.
