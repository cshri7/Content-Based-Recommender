Sometimes it is useful to split a string into separate strings, based on a regular expressions. The String class has a split() method, since Java 1.4, that will return a String array: Code section 3.93: Order.1 String person = "Brown, John:100 Yonge Street, Toronto:(416)777-9999";2 ...3 String[] personData = person.split(":");4 ...5 String name    = personData[0];6 String address = personData[1];7 String phone   = personData[2]; Another useful application could be to split the String text based on the new line character, so you could process the text line by line.
