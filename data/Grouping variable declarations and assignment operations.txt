Consider the following code: Code section 3.43: Ungrouped declarations.1 int a;2 int b;3 String c;4 a = 10;5 b = 20;6 c = "some text"; There are various ways by which you can streamline the writing of this code. You can group the declarations of similar data types in one statement, for instance: Code section 3.44: Grouped declarations.1 int a, b;2 String c;3 a = 10;4 b = 20;5 c = "some text"; Alternatively, you can further reduce the syntax by doing group declarations and assignments together, as such: Code section 3.45: Grouped declarations and assignments.1 int a = 10, b = 20;2 String c = "some text";
