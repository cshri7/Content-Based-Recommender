The switch conditional statement is basically a shorthand version of writing many if...else statements.  The syntax for switch statements is as follows: switch(<variable>) {  case <result>: <statements>; break;  case <result>: <statements>; break;  default: <statements>; break;} This means that if the variable included equals one of the case results, the statements following that case, until the word break will run.  The default case executes if none of the others are true.  Note: the only types that can be analysed through switch statements are char, byte, short, or int primitive types.  This means that Object variables can not by analyzed through switch statements. However, as of the JDK 7 release, you can use a String object in the expression of a switch statement. Code section 3.15: A switch. 1 int n = 2, x; 2 switch (n) { 3   case 1: x = 2; 4     break; 5   case 2: x = 4; 6     break; 7   case 3: x = 6; 8     break; 9   case 4: x = 8;10     break;11 }12 return x; In this example, since the integer variable n is equal to 2, case 2 will execute, make x equal to 4.  Thus, 4 is returned by the method.
