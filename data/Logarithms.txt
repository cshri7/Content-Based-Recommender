Java has no general logarithm function; when needed this can be simulated using the change-of-base theorem. double Math.log(double) returns the natural logarithm of the parameter (not the common logarithm, as its name suggests!). double Math.log10(double) returns the common (base-10) logarithm of the parameter. double Math.log1p(double) returns ln(parameter+1). It is recommended for small values.
