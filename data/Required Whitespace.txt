Look at the static method intValue: Code section 2.13: Method declaration1 private static int intValue(String data) {2   return Integer.parseInt(data);3 } Whitespace is required between private and static, between static and int, between int and intValue, and between String and data. If the code is written like this: Code section 2.14: Collapsed code1 privatestaticint intValue(String data) {2   return Integer.parseInt(data);3 } ...it means something completely different: it declares a method which has the return type privatestaticint It is unlikely that this type exists and the method is no longer static, so the above would result in a semantic error.
