Also referred to as if statements, these allow a program to perform a test and then take action based on the result of that test. The form of the if statement: if (condition) {  do statements here if condition is true} else {  do statements here if condition is false} The condition is a boolean expression which can be either true or false. The actions performed will depend on the value of the condition. Example: Code section 3.10: An if statement.1 if (i > 0) {2    System.out.println("value stored in i is greater than zero");3 } else {4    System.out.println("value stored is not greater than zero");5 } If statements can also be made more complex using the else if combination: if (condition 1) {   do statements here if condition 1 is true} else if (condition 2) {   do statements here if condition 1 is false and condition 2 is true} else {  do statements here if neither condition 1 nor condition 2 is true} Example: Code section 3.11: An if/else if/else statement.1 if (i > 0) {2    System.out.println("value stored in i is greater than zero");3 } else if (i < 0) {4    System.out.println("value stored in i is less than zero");5 } else {6    System.out.println("value stored is equal to 0");7 } If there is only one statement to be executed after the condition, as in the above example, it is possible to omit the curly braces, however Oracle's Java Code Conventions explicitly state that the braces should always be used. There is no looping involved in an if statement so once the condition has been evaluated the program will continue with the next instruction after the statement.
