An assertion checks if a condition is true: Code section 3.6: A return statement.1     public int getAge() {2         assert age >= 0;3         return age;4     } Each assert statement is ended by a semi-colon (;). However, assertions are disabled by default, so you must run the program with the -ea argument in order for assertions to be enabled (java -ea [name of compiled program]).
