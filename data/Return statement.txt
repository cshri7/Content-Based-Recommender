A return statement exits from a block, so it is often the last statement of a method: Code section 3.9: A return statement.1     public int getAge() {2         int age = 24;3         return age;4     } A return statement can return the content of a variable or nothing. Beware not to write statements after a return statement which would not be executed! Each return statement is ended by a semi-colon (;).
