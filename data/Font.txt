Using stylish fonts in your Java applets may be necessary to help keep your Java applets attractive.  The setFont() allows for either the font used throughout the applet to be defined or for one element's font to be set at a time. The syntax for setting a font is setFont(<fontName>, <fontStyle>, <fontSize>). To make every font in the applet plain, size 24 Times New Roman, the following code should be used: Code section 9.13: Font setting1 Font f = new Font("Times New Roman", Font.PLAIN, 24);2 setFont(f); It is not necessary to initialize the font and set the font through two different lines of code. Code section 9.14: Direct font setting1 setFont(new Font("Times New Roman", Font.PLAIN, 24)); However, to make the font of element a plain, size 24 Times New Roman, and element b italicized, size 28 Times New Roman, the following code should be used: Code section 9.15: Object font setting1 a.setFont(new Font("Times New Roman", Font.PLAIN, 24));2 b.setFont(new Font("Times New Roman", Font.ITALIC, 28)); To set the color of the fonts used in an applet, the setForeground(<color>) method is used.  This method already includes some predefined colors which can be used by calling, for example, setForeground(Color.white).  Here are all of the predefined colors: Color.black Color.blue Color.cyan Color.darkGray Color.gray Color.green Color.red Color.white Color.yellow To create a custom color, the RGB values of the color can be passed in as the color parameter.  For example, if red were not a predefined color, one could use setForeground(new Color(255, 0, 0)) to define red. Just as font styles, font colors can be applied to separate elements.  The syntax follows the same pattern: a.setForeground(Color.white).
