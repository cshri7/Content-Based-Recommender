A Runnable process block is a simple class that implements a run() method. Within the run() method is the actual task that needs to be executed by a running thread. By implementing a class with the Runnable interface, we ensure that the class holds a run() method. Consider the following program: Code listing 1: A runnable processimport java.util.Random;public class RunnableProcess implements Runnable {    private String name;    private int time;    private Random rand = new Random();    public RunnableProcess(String name) {        this.name = name;        this.time = rand.nextInt(999);    }    public void run() {        try {            System.out.printf("%s is sleeping for %d \n", this.name, this.time);            Thread.sleep(this.time);            System.out.printf("%s is done.\n", this.name);        } catch(Exception ex) {            ex.printStackTrace();        }    }} In the above code, we create a class called RunnableProcess and implement the Runnable interface to ensure that we have a run() method in the class declaration. Code section 1.1: Implementing the Runnable interfacepublic class RunnableProcess implements Runnable {    ...    public void run() {        ...    }} We then declare the rest of the logic for the class. For the constructor, we take a String parameter that would serve as the name of the class. Then, we initialize the class member variable time with a random number between 0 and 999. To ensure the initialization of a random number, we use the Random class in the java.util package. Code section 1.2: Including ability to generate random integers between 0 and 999import java.util.Random;...private Random rand = new Random();...this.time = rand.nextInt(999); The actual task that would be executed per this runnable block is presented within the run() method. To keep safe from exceptions occurring because of the concurrent programming, we wrap the code within this method with a try..catch block. The executing task actually consists of just three statements. The first outputs the provided name for the Runnable process, and the last reports that the thread has executed. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the code is the second statement: Thread.sleep(...). Code section 1.3: The actual runnable process task...System.out.printf("%s is sleeping for %d \n", this.name, this.time);Thread.sleep(this.time);System.out.printf("%s is done \n", this.name);... This statement allows the thread executing the current runnable block to halt its execution for the given amount of time. This time is presented in milliseconds. But for our convenience, this time would be the random number generated in the constructor and can be anywhere between 0 and 999 milliseconds. We will explore this in a later section. Creating a Runnable process block is just the beginning. No code is actually executed. To do so, we would require the creation of threads that would then individually execute this task.
