Now that we have the Java platform on our systems and have run the first program successfully, we are geared towards understanding how programs are actually made. As we have already discussed, a program is a set of instructions, which are tasks provided to a computer. These instructions are called statements in Java. Statements can be anything from a single line of code to a complex mathematical equation. Consider the following line: Code section 3.1: A simple assignment statement.1 int age = 24; This line is a simple instruction that tells the system to initialize a variable and set its value as 24. If the above statement was the only one in the program, it would look similar to this: Code listing 3.1: A statement in a simple class.1 public class MyProgram {2     public static void main(String[] args) {3         int age = 24;4     }5 } Java places its statements within a class declaration and, in the class declaration, the statements are usually placed in a method declaration, as above.
