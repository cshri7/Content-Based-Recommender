Main page: Java Programming/Keywords/for The for loop is a specialized while loop whose syntax is designed for easy iteration through a sequence of numbers. Example: Code section 3.16: A for loop.1 for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {2   System.out.println(i + "\t" + i * i);3 }Output for code listing 3.16 if you compile and run the statement above. 0      0 1      1 2      4 3      9 ... 99     9801 The program prints the numbers 0 to 99 and their squares. The same statement in a while loop: Code section 3.17: An alternative version.1 int i = 0;2 while (i < 100) {3    System.out.println(i + "\t" + i * i);4    i++;5 }
