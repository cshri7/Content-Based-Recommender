new is a Java keyword. It creates a Java object and allocates memory for it on the heap. new is also used for array creation, as arrays are also objects. Syntax: <JavaType> <variable> = new <JavaObject>(); For example: LinkedList list = new LinkedList();int[] intArray = new int[10];String[][] stringMatrix = new String[5][10]; See also:  Java Programming/Creating Objects
