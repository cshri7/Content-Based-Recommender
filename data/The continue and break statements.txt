At times, you would like to re-iterate a loop without executing the remaining statement within the loop. Thecontinue statement causes the loop to re-iterate and start over from the top most statement insidethe loop. Where there is an ability to re-iterate the loop, there is an ability to exit the loop when required. At any givenmoment, if you'd like to exit a loop and end all further work within the loop, the break ought to beused. The continue and break statements can be used with a label like follows: Code section 3.19: Using a label.1 String s = "A test string for the switch!\nLine two of test string...";2 outer: for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {3   switch (s.charAt(i)) {4     case '\n': break outer;5     case ' ': break;6     default: System.out.print(s.charAt(i));7   }8 }Output for code listing 3.19 Ateststringfortheswitch!
