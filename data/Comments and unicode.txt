Be aware that Java still interprets Unicode sequences within comments. For example, the Unicode sequence \u002a\u002f (whose codepoints correspond to */) is processed early in the Java compiler's lexical scanning of the source file, even before comments are processed, so this is a valid star-slash comment in Java: Code section 3.110: Unicode sequence interruption.1 /* This is a comment. \u002a\u002f2 String statement = "This is not a comment."; and is lexically equivalent to Code section 3.111: Unicode sequence interruption effect.1 /* This is a comment. */2 String statement = "This is not a comment."; (The '*' character is Unicode 002A and the '/' character is Unicode 002F.) Similar caveats apply to newline characters in slash-slash comments. For example: Code section 3.112: New line.1 // This is a single line comment \u000a This is code That is because \u000a is Unicode for a new line, making the compiler think that you have added a new line when you haven't.
