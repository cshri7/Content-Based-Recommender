Now, for instance, you want the annotation to know that if no value for the version element is present, then it should use a default value. Declaring a default value would be done the following way. Code listing 1.3: Using default values.@interface CodeDescription{    String author();    String version() default "1.0.0.1";} So, now if you use the same code again, you can ignore the version element because you know that the value is to be provided by default. Code listing 1.4: Pre-defined value.public class MyMethod{    @CodeDescription(author = "Sysop")    public void doSomething()    {        ...    }}
